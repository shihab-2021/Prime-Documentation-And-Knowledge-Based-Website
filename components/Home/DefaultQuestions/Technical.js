              In brief, we are responsible for the features that are advertised
              in the theme. So we will do the following: <br />– Solve bugs if
              there is any (bug means if any feature is not working as it
              should) <br />
              – If you have any question we will answer it <br /> – After your
              installation if you face any issues/bugs, we can look <br /> into
              your website or server, but we don’t guarantee any solution or
              custom works there.

              theme on only one website. If you want to use it on multiple
              websites, you must buy multiple licenses.
